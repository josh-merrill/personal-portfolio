### My process

- **Design**: I began the project by planning the website's layout and structure. I created wireframes and a design concept using Figma, ensuring a visually appealing and user-friendly interface.
- **Development**: I implemented the design using React, HTML, and CSS. I leveraged various React libraries and components to enhance interactivity and functionality.
- **Deployment**: The website is deployed using Vite, providing a fast and reliable hosting solution.


### What problem did I set out to fix?

The primary goal of this project was to create a personal portfolio website that showcases my skills and projects in an organized and visually engaging manner. I aimed to present my frontend development expertise through a clean, responsive, and user-friendly interface. By building this portfolio, I wanted to offer potential employers and clients an insight into my capabilities and work.


### What were some of the design decisions?

During the development process, I made several design decisions to create an effective and visually appealing portfolio:

- **Clean and Minimalistic**: I opted for a clean and minimalistic design to focus on the content and keep the user experience simple and distraction-free.
- **Responsive Design**: The website is fully responsive to ensure seamless accessibility on various devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.
- **Consistent Branding**: I maintained consistent branding elements throughout the website, such as the color scheme and font choices.


### What I learned

Throughout the development of this portfolio, I gained valuable experience and knowledge:

- **Advanced React Techniques**: I honed my skills in React, utilizing components, hooks, and state management to create a dynamic and interactive user interface.
- **CSS Styling and Flexibility**: I explored various CSS styling techniques and used Flexbox and CSS Grid for responsive layout design.
- **Deployment and Version Control**: I learned about deploying a React application and managing version control with Git and GitHub.


### What I would change if I had more time

Given more time, there are a few improvements and additional features I would like to implement:

- **Portfolio Filtering**: Add a feature to filter projects based on categories or technologies used, allowing users to find relevant projects quickly.
- **Interactive Resume**: Create an interactive and downloadable resume section to provide users with a more detailed overview of my skills and experiences.
- **Blog Section**: Introduce a blog section where I can share my insights and knowledge about frontend development and related topics.
